This project implements a PID controller to easily control microscopy samples using a PID controller. It is based on esp32 and other simple components ( 1" OLED display, DHT11 temperature sensor, thermistors, rotary encoder). 

The Arduino IDE code implements a user input menu to edit PID parameters (Kp, Ki,Kd etc). The Device can be connected to a PC to monitor the temperature as a function of time and further edit parameters. The PC control software is written in Python. 

More documentation to be provided soon
